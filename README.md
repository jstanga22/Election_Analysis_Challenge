 Summary:
  This script is incredibly modular thus making it useful for nearly any election. It could be used on a national level by changing counties to states and expanding it from three to fifty. This would give a detailed unsight as to how certain areas of the country vote, and which candidates carry those areas.  this could also be used to see which policies are popular instead of candidates. This would be an exact way to see what certain populations want out of their elected officials.
